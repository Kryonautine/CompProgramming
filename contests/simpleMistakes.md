# Common Mistakes in Submissions

* End outputs with endl/space them correctly
* Initialize variables to 0/empty (even the ones that will likely not need it)
* Make everything long long, even indexers
* When doing DP problems, make sure that the array is actually big enough. 10^5 = 100,000 not 10,000
